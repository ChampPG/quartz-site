Any small syntax sugar/etc. that doesn’t fit within another category will be included under this header.\nHighlighting Text\nText in Obsidian can be highlighted, with the following syntax: \\==highlighted==.\nDiagrams with Mermaid\nMermaid diagrams can be embedded into an Obsidian document, within a code block with the mermaid language.\nExample Flowchart\nThis link has many Mermaid examples, one of which is displayed below, rendered by Obsidian:\nflowchart LR\n\nA[Hard] --&gt;|Text| B(Round)\nB --&gt; C{Decision}\nC --&gt;|One| D[Result 1]\nC --&gt;|Two| E[Result 2]\n\nWorking with Images\nMinimal Theme Filters\nWhen using the Minimal Theme, filters can be applied to images to modify their appearance (link).\n\nAdd with ![[image.jpg|#filter]]\n#invert - Invert images in dark mode (light ⇒ dark)\n#circle - Crop image to a circle\n#outline - Add outline around image\n\nAdjusting Size\nThe size of an image can be adjusted by including one or both dimensions in the image tag, like so:\nEmbed:\n![[image.jpg|100x100]]\n![[image.jpg|100]]  &lt;-- Scales based on aspect ratio\n \nLinked Image:\n\\![AltText|100x100](hxxp://link/to/image.jpg)\nCallouts\n\n\n                  \n                  Info\n                  \n                \nThe complete documentation on callouts can be found here.\n\nCallouts can be added to a note using the following syntax:\n&gt; [!TYPE] Title\n&gt; \n&gt; Conents of callout\n&gt; can be multiple lines\n\nThe Title is optional, and will be replaced with the callout type if absent.\nCallouts are optionally collapsible, defaulting to collapsed or expanded based on syntax.\n\n[!TYPE]- to start collapsed\n[!TYPE]+ to start expanded\n\n\n\nCallout Types\nThe following callout types are usable by default:\n\nnote\nabstract\n\nsummary, tldr\n\n\ninfo\ntodo\ntip\n\nhint, important\n\n\nsuccess\n\ncheck, done\n\n\nquestion\n\nhelp, faq\n\n\nwarning\n\ncaution, attention\n\n\nfailure\n\nfail, missing\n\n\ndanger\n\nerror\n\n\nbug\nexample\nquote\n\ncite\n\n\n\nLinks vs. Tags\nConceptual Uses for Each\n\nVia Obsidian forums\n\nA link points/directs to another file\nA tag marks a note, or a part of a note.\n\nHelpful for search filters and general grouping\n\n\n\n\nVia A Guide On Links vs. Tags\n\nLinks vs. Tags\n\nWhat Obsidian calls a link can be defined as: “A connection from one note to another note”.\nIn Obsidian, a tag is: “A connection from a note to an idea”.\n\n\nNodes\n\nEvery note in your vault is a “node”, as you see when you open the graph view.\nEvery tag is also a node, just with no file behind it\n\n\nThis concept is..\n\nUseful for: If you want to use tags in graph view to identify emergent concepts\n\nwhen enough notes share a #tag, the node gets real big in graph view\n\n\nNot useful for: If you also use tags for status or type (book, person, etc.) (ref).\n\n\n\n\n\nPlugins\nTemplater\nThe Templater plugin allows for embedded JavaScript to be executed when a template is inserted. These templates can also be evaluated in existing documents (Alt + R).\nInsert File Creation Date\n&lt;% tp.file.creation_date(&quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;) %&gt;\nPlugins to check out\n\nBreadcrumbs\n\nHierarchical links between notes\n\n\nAuto note mover - move notes based on rules (filename/tag)\n\nInstalled - to learn\n\nTag folders\n"},"everything/Refernces/Vim":{"title":"Vim","links":["everything/Refernces/Neovim","lazyvim"],"tags":["software","ref"],"content":"Sub Refernces\n\nNeovim\nlazyvim\n"}}
